# Local anime/manga source
Frequently Asked Questions about the Local anime/manga source.

## How can I import my downloaded series?
For a step-by-step process, we recommend referring to [this guide for local manga source](/docs/guides/local-manga-source/) or [this guide for local anime source](/docs/guides/local-anime-source/).

## What should I do if I can't find the Aniyomi folder?
In case the **Aniyomi** folder is not visible, create one using a file manager.

## How can I resolve empty/blank covers?
Occasionally, cover images for local series might not appear.

1. Confirm that you've organized the folder structure correctly.
   * To verify, access the series with the missing cover and see if you can watch episodes/read chapters within the app.
   * If not, follow the [provided guide](/docs/guides/local-anime-source/#folder-structure) first.
1. Capture a screenshot of the watched episodes/read chapters, then remove the series from your library.
1. Navigate to <nav to="advanced"> and tap **Clear database**.
   * This action will only affect series not in your library.
2. Return to <nav to="sources">, go to **Local anime source** or **Local manga source** and locate the series.
   * The cover issue should now be resolved.
   * Re-add the series to your library, mark your watched episodes/read chapters, and re-enable tracking if necessary.
